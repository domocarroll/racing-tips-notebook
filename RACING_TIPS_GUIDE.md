# Racing Tips Notebook - User Guide

## Overview

**Racing Tips Notebook** is an AI-powered system for aggregating and analyzing horse racing tips from multiple sources. Built on the Open Notebook platform, it combines powerful AI capabilities with a user-friendly interface to help you make sense of racing tips data.

   2. The consensus for place positions (2nd, 3rd)
   3. Any notable patterns or agreements among tipsters
   4. Horses that appear frequently but not for 1st place
   ```
5. Apply this transformation to any source

## Workflow Examples

### Workflow 1: Weekly Racing Tips Aggregation

1. **Monday**: Create notebook "Weekend Racing - Oct 25-26"
2. **Tuesday-Friday**: Upload tip sheets as they're published
   - Herald Sun tips
   - Racing Post tips
   - Form guides
   - Expert selections
3. **Saturday morning**: 
   - Chat with the notebook: "What are the consensus picks for today?"
   - Generate a summary report
   - Review horses with strong tipster support
4. **Sunday**: Add actual results and compare

### Workflow 2: Tipster Performance Tracking

1. Create notebooks for each race meeting
2. Upload all tipster selections
3. After the races, add results as notes
4. Use search to query: "Show me all tips from [tipster name]"
5. Compare their picks against actual results
6. Track accuracy over time

### Workflow 3: Form Guide Analysis

1. Upload racing form guides (PDFs or images)
2. Upload tipster selections
3. Create a notebook combining both sources
4. Chat: "Compare the form guide recommendations with tipster consensus"
5. Generate insights about agreement/disagreement
6. Identify value picks where form differs from tips

## Tips for Best Results

### OCR Extraction Tips

1. **Image Quality**: Higher resolution images produce better OCR results
2. **Lighting**: Ensure tip sheets are well-lit and not shadowed
3. **Orientation**: Upload images in correct orientation (not rotated)
4. **Format**: PNG or JPEG work best; TIFF is also supported
5. **Multi-page**: For multi-page documents, upload as a single PDF if possible

### Organizing Your Data

1. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent notebook names (e.g., "Venue - Date")
2. **Tag Sources**: Add descriptive titles to sources (e.g., "Herald Sun - Flemington - Oct 25")
3. **Regular Cleanup**: Archive old notebooks to keep the interface clean
4. **Separate by Meeting**: Create one notebook per race meeting for clarity

### Querying Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Include venue, date, or race number in queries
2. **Use Context**: Chat within a notebook for meeting-specific questions
3. **Iterate**: If results aren't perfect, rephrase your question
4. **Cite Sources**: Always check the source citations in results

## Troubleshooting

### OCR Not Working

**Problem**: Uploaded tip sheet but no tips extracted

**Solutions**:
- Verify your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Check image quality (should be clear and readable)
- Try uploading as PDF instead of image
- Ensure the tip sheet has a standard columnar format

### Poor Extraction Quality

**Problem**: Tips extracted but many errors or missing data

**Solutions**:
- Use higher resolution images (300 DPI or higher)
- Ensure text is clear and not blurred
- Try a different AI provider (switch between Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini)
- For complex layouts, consider manual data entry

### Search Not Finding Tips

**Problem**: Search returns no results even though tips exist

**Solutions**:
- Wait a few minutes for embeddings to be generated
- Check that sources are linked to notebooks
- Try more general search terms
- Verify the tips were successfully extracted (check source detail page)

### Slow Performance

**Problem**: AI responses are slow or timing out

**Solutions**:
- Increase `API_CLIENT_TIMEOUT` in docker.env (try 600 seconds)
- If using Ollama locally, ensure GPU acceleration is enabled
- Consider using cloud AI providers (Anthropic/OpenAI) for faster responses
- Reduce the number of sources in a single notebook

## Data Privacy

Racing Tips Notebook is designed with privacy in mind:

- **Self-hosted**: All data stays on your server
- **No external storage**: Tips are stored in your local SurrealDB instance
- **API key control**: You control which AI providers see your data
- **Local AI option**: Use Ollama for 100% local processing (no cloud APIs)

## Advanced Features

### API Access

Racing Tips Notebook includes a full REST API:

- **Documentation**: http://localhost:5055/docs
- **Endpoints**: Create notebooks, upload sources, query tips programmatically
- **Automation**: Build scripts to automatically upload daily tip sheets
