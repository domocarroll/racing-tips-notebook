# Racing Tips Notebook - Adaptation Summary

## Overview

**Racing Tips Notebook** is a specialized fork of [Open Notebook](https://github.com/lfnovo/open-notebook) adapted for aggregating and analyzing horse racing tips. This document explains what was changed and why.

## What is Open Notebook?

Open Notebook is an open-source, privacy-focused alternative to Google's Notebook LM. It provides:

- AI-powered document processing and analysis
- Multi-modal content support (PDFs, images, audio, video, web pages)
- Natural language search and chat capabilities
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Support for 16+ AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, etc.)
- Docker-based deployment
- Self-hosted architecture for data privacy

## Why Use Open Notebook for Racing Tips?

The racing-tips-analyzer project you've been working on has had build and deployment issues. Open Notebook provides a more robust foundation:

### Advantages

1. **Proven Architecture**: 7.8k stars, actively maintained, production-ready
2. **Docker Deployment**: Single-container deployment avoids Vercel/serverless issues
3. **Built-in OCR**: Already supports vision AI for image extraction
4. **Natural Language Queries**: AI-powered search out of the box
5. **Flexible Storage**: SurrealDB handles complex racing data structures
6. **Multi-provider AI**: Switch between Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini easily
7. **No Build Issues**: Stable Next.js + FastAPI architecture

## How to Use for Racing Tips

### Core Workflow

1. **Create Notebooks**: Organize tips by race meeting
   - Example: "Flemington Saturday 2025-10-25"

2. **Upload Tip Sheets**: Add newspaper images or PDFs
   - AI automatically extracts tipster columns
   - Parses race numbers, horse names, positions

3. **Query with Natural Language**:
   - "Show me all tips for race 3"
   - "Which horses have the most tips for 1st place?"
   - "Compare tipsters for Flemington"

4. **Chat for Analysis**:
   - "What's the consensus pick for race 1?"
   - "Which tipsters picked horse number 7?"
   - "Show me the expert agreement for this meeting"

5. **Generate Insights**:
   - Create custom transformations for racing analysis
   - Generate consensus reports
   - Track tipster performance over time

### Advanced Features

**Tipster Performance Tracking:**
- Upload tips before races
- Add results after races (as notes)
- Query tipster accuracy over time
- Compare tipster performance

**Form Guide Integration:**
- Upload racing form guides alongside tips
- Compare form recommendations with tipster consensus
- Identify value picks where opinions differ

**Multi-Meeting Analysis:**
- Create notebooks for multiple meetings
- Search across all meetings
- Identify patterns and trends
- Track horses across different venues

## Migration from racing-tips-analyzer

If you want to migrate data from racing-tips-analyzer:

### Option 1: Fresh Start (Recommended)

1. Deploy Racing Tips Notebook
2. Re-upload tip sheets (AI will re-extract)
3. Organize into notebooks
4. Start fresh with better architecture

### Option 2: Data Migration

1. Export data from Supabase (racing-tips-analyzer)
2. Transform to Open Notebook format
3. Import via API or database migration
4. Requires custom migration script

**Recommendation**: Start fresh. The improved OCR and AI capabilities will likely produce better results than migrating old data.

### 2. Flexibility

- **16+ AI providers**: Switch providers easily
- **Local AI option**: Use Ollama for privacy
- **Custom transformations**: Create racing-specific AI workflows
- **Full API access**: Automate tip sheet uploads

### 3. Features

- **Better OCR**: Vision AI models excel at tip sheet extraction
- **Natural language search**: Query tips conversationally
- **AI chat**: Ask questions about your tips database
- **Vector search**: Find similar tips and patterns
- **Podcast generation**: Optional audio analysis of tips

### 4. Privacy

- **Self-hosted**: All data stays on your server
- **No external services**: Except AI providers (optional)
- **Local AI option**: Use Ollama for 100% local processing
- **Full control**: You own the data and infrastructure

## Next Steps
