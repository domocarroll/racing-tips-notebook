# Racing Tips Notebook - Quick Start

Get up and running with Racing Tips Notebook in 5 minutes!

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your computer
- An Anthropic API key (recommended) or OpenAI API key
  - Get Anthropic key: https://console.anthropic.com/
  - Get OpenAI key: https://platform.openai.com/

## Installation

### Step 1: Create a directory

```bash
mkdir racing-tips-notebook
cd racing-tips-notebook
```

### Step 2: Create docker-compose.yml

Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` with this content:

```yaml
services:
  racing_tips_notebook:
    image: domocarroll/racing-tips-notebook:latest
    ports:
      - "8502:8502"
      - "5055:5055"
    environment:
      - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here
      - SURREAL_URL=ws://localhost:8000/rpc
      - SURREAL_USER=root
      - SURREAL_PASSWORD=root

      - SURREAL_DATABASE=production
    volumes:
      - ./notebook_data:/app/data
      - ./surreal_data:/mydata
    restart: always
```

**Important**: Replace `your_anthropic_key_here` with your actual API key!

### Step 3: Start the container

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will:
- Download the Racing Tips Notebook image (~2GB)

## Common Issues

### "Unable to connect to server"

**Problem**: Can't access http://localhost:8502

**Solution**: Wait 1-2 minutes for all services to start. Check status:
```bash
docker compose ps
```

All services should show "Up" status.

### "API key not found"

**Problem**: OCR extraction fails with API key error

**Solution**: Make sure you replaced `your_anthropic_key_here` in docker-compose.yml with your actual API key. Then restart:
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

### "Port already in use"

**Problem**: Error about port 8502 or 5055 already in use

**Solution**: Change the ports in docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
ports:
  - "8503:8502"  # Use 8503 instead
  - "5056:5055"  # Use 5056 instead
```

Then access at http://localhost:8503

### OCR not extracting tips

**Problem**: Uploaded tip sheet but no tips extracted

**Solutions**:
1. Check image quality (should be clear and readable)
2. Ensure tip sheet has a standard columnar format
3. Try uploading as PDF instead of image
4. Verify your API key has credits/quota remaining
